# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Notes

* in order to run APP localy please insert your ACCESS_KEY from unsplash into `src/api/unsplash.ts`
* I only wrote some integration tests, but a lot more unit tests could have been written if I had time and desire ;)
* I've used Ant Design for some UI elements (buttons, spinner etc.), cause I'm just too lazy to create them from scratch ;)
